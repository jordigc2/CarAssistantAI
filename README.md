# CarAssistantAI
This project aims to design and develop an AI agent integrated into the
multimedia unit of Toyota cars. The AI agent is designed to interact with and
support users by providing accurate and timely information based on car
manuals. While the broader vision included leveraging user past interactions
with car systems and car log data, the current scope focuses on delivering
information from the car manuals due to data and computational
constraints.
The project encompasses several stages, including system planning, pipeline
selection, library choices, and deployment considerations. This document
provides a comprehensive overview of the system design, detailing the
architecture, components, and functionalities of the AI agent.
